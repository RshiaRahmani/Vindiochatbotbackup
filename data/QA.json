This approach aims to capture more information about the object, potentially leading to improved object recognition accuracy."

    "Question": "What will the QV Python library be called?",
    "Answer": "vindioai"
  },
  {
    "Question": "What is particle-wave duality and how does it inspire QV theory?",
    "Answer": "In quantum physics, quantum-scale objects can behave as waves when unobserved and as particles when measured. QV theory applies this analogy to human-scale objects, suggesting that they may have wave-like representations containing richer information than still images."
  },
  {
    "Question": "How does QV theory relate to human vision?",
    "Answer": "In human vision, light waves enter the eye, pass through biological neurons, and collapse into solid objects in the visual cortex. QV theory mimics this by creating wave-like representations of objects before classification in deep learning models."
  },
  {
    "Question": "What is the QV block?",
    "Answer": "The QV block is a mathematical model in deep learning that converts still images into information wave functions inspired by quantum physics. These wave functions are then fed into DNNs instead of the original images."
  },
  {
    "Question": "What are the main contributions of the QV Theory?",
    "Answer": "Introduction of Quantum Vision theory for object recognition.  Development of the QV block to convert images into information wave functions. Demonstration of QV integration into CNNs, ViTs, and CCTs. Experimental evidence of improved accuracy across datasets."

  },
  {
    "Question": "In QV (Quantum Vision) theory, I feed object images or information waves of objects to deep neural networks?",
    "Answer": "In QV, object images are converted to information waves, and these information waves are fed to deep neural networks rather than still images"
  },

  },
  {
    "Question": "How does QV theory differ from other Quantum circuit approaches?",
    "Answer": "QV theory does not run on quantum hardware. Instead, it uses deep learning to mathematically create 'information wave functions' from still images, inspired by quantum particle-wave duality. These wave functions are then fed into DNNs for classification."
  },
  {
    "Question": "Does QV theory require a quantum computer?",
    "Answer": "No. QV theory is implemented on classical deep learning architectures, such as CNNs, Vision Transformers, and Convolutional Vision Transformers."
  },
  {
    "Question": "What is the main conceptual difference between QV theory and QCNN?",

  },
  {
    "Question": "Were transfer learning or pre-training used in the experiments?",
    "Answer": "No. All models were trained from scratch without any transfer learning."
  },
  {
    "Question": "Which models achieved the best results?",
    "Answer": "QV-CNN-Heavy achieved top performances on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Oxford Flowers 102, while QV-ViT/8-8 achieved the best result on Fashion-MNIST without pre-training."
  },
  {
    "Question": "Can a lightweight CNN with QV block outperform a heavyweight CNN without it?",

  },
  {
    "Question": "Which model types benefit most from the QV block?",

  },
  {
    "Question": "In QV, what is the meaning of momentum magnitude?",
    "Answer": "Momentum magnitude is a quantum number representing the direction and magnitude of motion. For example, if momentum magnitude m=2, it means that amount of motion is +-1 and +-2. Shift and substract kernels will apply a motion of +-1 and +-2"
  },
  {
    "Question": "Can I modify the number of branches in a QVBlock?",
    "Answer": "Yes, you can modify. Amd it is directly related to the momentum magnitude, m, parameter. If momentum magnitude is [1, 2] or [2, 4], there are eight branches with either +-1 and +-2 ShiftSubtract kernels OR +-2 and +-4 ShiftSubtract kernels. "
  },
  {
    "Question": "Does the QV block improve performance even with a small channel size, wave number?",
    "Answer": "Yes. Even with 8 channels/waves, QV-CNN-Heavy achieved 94.06%, outperforming the CNN-Heavy without QV (92.15%)."
  },
  {
    "Question": "How to optimize or it is possible to optimize QV Model training times?",

Default is 128 waves, you can make it 64, 32, 16, even 8. Option 3 - Instead of 8 braches with momentum direction of [1, 2] or [2, 4], you can try four branches with [1] or [2]"
  },
  {
    "Question": "Which input image sizes are supported by QV Theory?",
    "Answer": "You can try [64, 64, 3] for small image sizes and [224, 224, 3] for larger image sizes"

  },
  {
    "Question": "How can training time be reduced while still gaining accuracy benefits from QV?",
    "Answer": "By reducing the number of branches, channel size, or convolutional layers per branch. For example, using 4 branches reduces training time to 3m 5s with 94.18% accuracy, or reducing channel size to 16 waves lowers time to 1m 32s with 94.11% accuracy on CIFAR-10."
